Machine Learning Project - Random Forest Regressor Optimization
This project is focused on optimizing a Random Forest Regressor model using GridSearchCV from the sklearn library. The goal is to find the best hyperparameters that will yield the highest accuracy for the model.

Project Structure
The project consists of a single Jupyter notebook file, MachinLearning_project-2.ipynb.

Code Overview
The code begins by importing necessary libraries, including GridSearchCV and RandomForestRegressor from sklearn, and numpy.

A grid of hyperparameters is defined for the Random Forest Regressor model. This includes:

n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest. The grid searches from 100 to 1000 in steps of 100.
max_depth: The maximum depth of the tree. The grid searches from 15 to 20.
max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. The grid considers 1 or 'sqrt'.
GridSearchCV is then initialized with the RandomForestRegressor as the estimator, the defined grid as the parameter grid, and accuracy as the scoring method. The cross-validation fold is set to 5, and all processors are used (n_jobs=-1).

The GridSearchCV is fitted to the data (x, y), and the best parameters are extracted and stored in best_params.

Usage
To use this project, you will need to provide your own data (x, y) to fit the GridSearchCV. After running the code, you can check the best_params variable to see the best parameters found by the grid search.

Dependencies
Python
sklearn
numpy
Future Work
Future work may include expanding the grid to search a wider range of hyperparameters, or using a different model for optimization.
